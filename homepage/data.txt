Introduction:
Hi! Welcome to my homepage, which I've made for <a id="pset8" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/8/homepage">Problem Set 8</a> of <a id="cs50x" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021">CS50x</a>, 
a fantastic Computer Science course by Harvard. I first tried the course way back in 2019, when I was still 12 and didn't 
have a good grasp of the crucial concepts of programming, so I found the problem sets bafflingly difficult. I stopped after 
Week 2. Two years passed and during the summer holidays this year, I decided to give it another try. I'm doing much better 
this time around, and I aim to finish the Final Project by December. 
<br> <br>
I plan to use this as my personal page, and will continually update it with new posts, projects and features. 
In the meantime, feel free to explore around.

<h2>Ricing</h2>
            <p>By "rice", I mean desktop customization. I've been using Arch Linux for quite a few months now, and 
                love tinkering around with different parts of my system's UI components, including window managers, status bars 
                and keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, I enjoy writing up short shell scripts to liven up my otherwise bland
                terminals and creating colorschemes to match my wallpaper. 
<!--Table Tennis-->
            <h2>Table Tennis</h2>
            <p>I've never really been talented at sports, but among them, table tennis is the one I find most enjoyable. 
                I used to play at our local club but because of the pandemic, I currently play at home with my dad, who
                often invites a few of his friends over. What I love about table tennis is that it does not require a team
                (I'm terrible at team sports), and has a fast-paced yet strategic playing style.
